The xping protocol works by flooding basic UDP packets  to each switch specific IP address.

Inside the packet is a two byte magic number (set to 0x83 0x30, 8330 is the asn of the company that's commissioned this), 
then a 64-bit unsigned integer for a sequence number ( this is used to  help calculate packet loss)

Received it is put into a receive ring buffer so that when the calculations for packet loss and latency is needed, the 
ring buffer is iterated through to calculate missing packets (and average latency)

The program uses SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE to help mitigate garbage collection spikes, however
because the transmit path is not time stamped, spikes can still appear from time to time.

Transmit side timestamping was not implemented becuase of its inflexibly and extra complexity.

There is no handshake between hosts, as things are expected to be statically configured
